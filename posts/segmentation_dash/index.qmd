This [*Quarto Dashboard*](https://aambarek.shinyapps.io/segmentation_dashboard/) provides visual insights into customer behavioral segmentation for phone usage patterns. It showcases clustering results, allowing you to understand distinct customer groups based on their behavior.

The unsupervised learning algorithm employed here is `kmeans`, which utilizes a set of features including:

• Average call duration

• Average number of calls per day

• Average number of SMS per day

• % daytime calls (9am -3pm)

• % evening calls (6pm-10pm)

• % of weekday calls

• % of Saturday calls

• % of Sunday calls

You have the flexibility to choose the number of clusters, allowing for tailored segmentation analysis. Dive deeper into each cluster's profile to understand the distribution of the features.
