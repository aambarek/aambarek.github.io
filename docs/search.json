According to data from the OECD on prices, by July 2022, many European countries saw prices shoot up by more than 10% compared to the previous year. Turkey, for example, saw prices shoot up by a whopping 79% compared to July 2021.\nThe impact of food and fuel prices on this inflation frenzy varies depending on structure of consumption in each country. In most European countries, about 20% of the inflation came from higher fuel prices. But in places like Hungary, Columbia, Mexico, and Morocco, it was the cost of food that played the biggest role in driving up prices for everyone."

And \\(Y\\) denotes the distribution of the total income.\nThus, Absolute Contribution for the \\(k^{th}\\) income source is the product \\(S_k \\Gamma(Y_k,Y) Gini(Y_k)\\)\nStark and al.¬†(1986) showed that this decomposition equation offers a simple method to assess the marginal effect on total income inequality following a marginal percentage variation in income from a given source, equal for all households. Thus, the impact of an increase in income from source \\(k\\), for all households, in such a way that \\(Y_k\\) is multiplied by \\((1 + e_k)\\), where \\(e_k\\) is sufficiently small can be represented as follow :\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial Gini(Y)}{\\partial e_k} = S_k (\\Gamma(Y_k,Y) Gini(Y_k)- Gini(Y))\n\\]\nThis expression show a measure for the marginal contribution of source \\(k\\) to the overall inequality. It can be expressed differently to reveal the relative marginal contribution of inequality due to a marginal variation in the income from source \\(k\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial Gini(Y) / \\partial e_k}{Gini(Y)} = S_k (\\frac{\\Gamma(Y_k,Y) Gini(Y_k)}{Gini(Y)}- 1) = S_k(\\eta_k-1)\n\\]\nWhere\n\\[\n\\eta_k = \\frac{\\Gamma(Y_k,Y) Gini(Y_k)}{Gini(Y)}\n\\] \\(\\eta_k\\) will denote the elasticity of Gini index associated with a percentage change in the mean income (for each income source)\nThis definition clearly demonstrates that the marginal impact of a source of income depends on its income elasticity of the Gini index. Thus, a percentage increase in the income from a source with a lower \\(\\eta_k\\) (higher) than 1, will decrease (increase), the overall income inequality.

In other words, such a function combines both the social preference for more income and that for more equality. It is an increasing function of the mean and decreasing function of inequality (Essama-Nssah, 2000).\nSen (1997) showed, under the assumption that individual well-being is approximated by individual income and that the well-being of any pair of individuals equals that of the poorest, then the following expression can be considered as a function of social welfare underlying the Gini coefficient.\n\\[\nSW = \\bar{Y} (1-G))\n\\] Where \\(\\bar{Y}\\) denotes average income and \\(G\\) the Gini index.\nUsing the decomposition of \\(G\\), the impact of a variation in an income source on the Social Welfare function is estimated according to the following formulation:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta SW}{SW} \\mid _{Y_k} = \\frac{S_k}{1-Gini(Y)} -  \\frac{S_k\\Gamma(Y_k,Y)Gini(Y_k)}{1-Gini(Y)}\n\\]\nsocial_welfare_impact function provides a Growth-redistribution decomposition of the impact of a variation in each income source on the Social Welfare function.\nThe output of the function is three columns (added to the decomposition components described before)\n\nTotal_Variation = \\(\\frac{\\Delta SW}{SW} \\mid _{Y_k}\\);\nGrowth_Effect = \\(\\frac{S_k}{1-Gini(Y)}\\);\nRedistribution_Effect = \\(- \\frac{S_k\\Gamma(Y_k,Y)Gini(Y_k)}{1-Gini(Y)}\\)\n\n\nsample_income_data |&gt; \n   social_welfare_impact(wage, self_employment_rev, farming_rev, other_rev,\n   .wgt = sample_wgt)\n\n# A tibble: 4 √ó 7\n  income_source       Share  Gini Gini_corr Growth_Effect Redistribution_Effect Total_Variation\n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 farming_rev         0.125 0.926     0.620         0.215               -0.123           0.0917\n2 other_rev           0.352 0.574     0.600         0.607               -0.209           0.398 \n3 self_employment_rev 0.136 0.864     0.424         0.234               -0.0858          0.148 \n4 wage                0.388 0.697     0.659         0.669               -0.308           0.362"

Observing the trends, we can discern how changes in economic policies and priorities under different political ideologies have impacted the nation‚Äôs economic performance.\nFor instance, during periods of Democratic administrations, we often observe a focus on stimulating economic growth through measures such as increased government spending and investment in social programs, leading to higher GDP growth rates. Conversely, Republican administrations may prioritize policies aimed at reducing government intervention and promoting business growth, which could influence fluctuations in unemployment rates."

This user-friendly dashboard helps you explore important indicators that show how spending is distributed.\n\nGini Index: See how spending inequality changes over time using the Gini index, a measure that shows if spending is distributed fairly.\nShares of different population groups: Understand how spending is split among different groups of people, like rich and poor, to see who spends more.\nRatio of highest to lowest spending: Find out how much more the richest people spend compared to the poorest, showing how money is concentrated.\n\n\n\nUsers have the flexibility to tailor their exploration by selecting between rural and urban areas, offering nuanced insights into regional expenditure dynamics. Additionally, users can adjust how the population is segmented, enabling a granular examination of expenditure concentration patterns.\nAll the indicators were calculated based on micro data of National Surveys of Consumption and Expenditures of Households (2001, 2007, 2014, 2019) conducted by the High Commission for Planning.\nYou can access to the Web App here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The estimation of poverty requires data on income or consumption expenditures, such data is generally collected by national statistics offices through Household Expenditure Surveys (known as HES). These surveys require a costly budget that statistical agencies cannot afford every year or within short intervals. Usually, such surveys are conducted every 4-7 years. Therefore, researchers find themselves in data upgrade constraint when there is a great need to update poverty indicators. On another side, the Labor Force Survey (LFS), which has a relatively lightweight questionnaire, is less costly comparing to HES. LFS surveys are conducted regularly every year and sometimes within quarterly intervals. They hold a rich source of information about households, namely economic and social status of households, demographics and living conditions. In addition, most of mentioned characteristics are considered as common sections in LFS and HES questionnaires.\nThe methodology consisted in using predictive modelling in conjunction with multiple imputation. We adopted a machine learning approach to build models for predicting household‚Äôs consumption expenditures on the basis of data from LFS and HES 2014. We used cross-survey technique to impute consumption in labor force survey in the purpose of estimating poverty rate for periods when consumption distribution is not available. Two kinds of models were trained separately on rural and urban areas, linear models reveal a good prediction performance, but with over estimation, leaving suspicious bias in the estimation of proportion under poverty line. In contrast, random forest method yields better results especially in urban area.\nKeywords: poverty, machine learning, predictive modelling, cross-survey imputation, multiple imputation, random forest \nCheck the full article here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Employment is a form of social integration and major actor in wealth creation and income allocation. Despite actions undertaken to promote the national labour market and create more jobs for youth, youth keep facing more intense challenges related to quantitative issues, such as the high level of unemployment and the low female labour force participation rate, and other qualitative issues related to the adequacy of training/employment, low labour productivity, and underemployment. The latter is a key indicator of labour market performance. It is a relevant measure of the unused potential of the labour force that leads to losses in productivity and profitability and other socio-economic costs at the micro and macro levels.\nAccording to the High Commission for Planning (HCP, Morocco), the under-employed population reached more than one million people in 2021 including 325,400 of youth aged between 15 and 29 years, giving an underemployment rate of 9.3% and 14.6% among youth between 15 and 29 years old. The level of underemployment endures high in Morocco and requires in-depth analysis to fully understand the underlying causes behind this phenomenon. The objective of this study is to examine the extent to which contextual and individual factors may be driving youth underemployment in Morocco.\nBased on data from the 2021 National Employment Survey, and using binomial logistic regression model, it has been revealed that employment sector, geographical location, and qualification level are main factors explaining the underemployment situation of youth in Morocco. Indeed, youth working in the private agricultural sector are 24% more likely to be underemployed than those in the public sector. Youth with a university degree are 14% more likely to be underemployed than those without a degree. The geographical dimension also increases the risk of underemployment: Youth living in certain regions are more likely to be underemployed with a relative risk that exceeds 14% compared to those living in Casablanca-Settat. Gender in its turn has a significant impact on the risk of being underemployed: Being young female decreases the risk of being underemployed by 8.3%.\nKeywords: labour market, logistic-regression, underemployment, youth\n\nCheck the full article here"
